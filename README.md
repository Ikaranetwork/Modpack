## Experimentation
These mods may have incompatibility with some mods and are use at your own risk

- [Vulcan Render](https://modrinth.com/mod/vulkanmod) (Very experimental but has shown promising performance gains.)
- [Nvidium](https://modrinth.com/mod/nvidium) (Only works for Rtx 20 Series cards & above!)
- [Distant Horizons](https://modrinth.com/mod/distanthorizons) (Has compatibility issues with most shaders)

*To try out the branches with Nvidium or Vulcan, make sure to change the branch from main to either nvidium or vulcan*
